# demo
The project is a backend application for an online auction website. It is built using Java and the Spring Boot framework,
and uses a MySQL or Microsoft SQL Server database to store data.

The application provides several REST APIs for creating, updating, and retrieving products and campaigns.
Products represent items that are up for auction, while campaigns represent time-limited sales events that include a group of related products.

Users can place bids on products through the APIs, and the application keeps track of the highest bid for each product.
The application also provides an API for retrieving the product with the highest bid.

The project uses validation to ensure that all input data is properly formatted and within acceptable ranges.
It also uses exception handling to provide informative error messages in case of failures.

Overall, the application provides a reliable and scalable backend for an online auction website.
